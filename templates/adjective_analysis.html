                   <h1>Pronoun Adjective Usage</h1>
                    <p>The code used for this analysis can be found in
                        <a href="https://github.com/dhmit/gender_novels/blob/master/gender_novels/analysis/pronoun_adjective_analysis.py">pronoun_adjective_analysis.py</a>.</p>

                    <p>The raw analysis returns a dictionary with each novel mapped to an array of 2 dictionaries:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Each adjective and its number of occurrences associated with male pronouns</li>
                        <li>Each adjective and its number of occurrences associated with female pronouns</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>For each novel, this analysis is conducted by iterating through the novel's tokenized text and considering windows of 10 words.
                        When the central word of a window is a gendered pronoun, any adjectives also in the window are added to a dictionary.
                        If there are additionally any opposite-gendered pronouns also in the window then the adjectives are discarded
                        (as they are technically associated with both gender pronouns in that case).</p>
                   <h2>Top 20 Adjectives Associated with Each Gender</h2>
                    <p><strong>These were obtained by calculating the difference between adjective associations with male pronouns, and with female pronouns:</strong> </p>
                    <p>number of male pronoun associations â€“ number of female pronoun associations = difference value</p>
                    <p>Adjectives with the highest positive difference values demonstrate the strongest male pronoun association,
                        and adjectives with the highest negative difference values demonstrate the strongest female pronoun association.</p>
