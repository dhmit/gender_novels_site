                   <h1>Basic Subject vs Object Pronoun Frequency Analysis</h1>

<p><strong>This page contains data from an analysis of feminine
and masculine subject pronouns vs object pronouns.</strong></p>

<p>The code used for this analysis can be found in
gender_pronoun_freq_analysis.py</p>

<p>Two analyses were conducted on this subject. The first compares
how often each gender's pronouns were used in the subject within
their gender, i.e., what portion of female pronouns are subject pronouns
and what portion of male pronouns are subject pronouns. The
second analysis compares the frequency of masculine and
feminine pronouns in subject pronouns, ie, what portion of
subject pronouns are masculine vs feminine.</p>

<h2>First Analysis</h2>

<p>This analysis first separated the pronouns into masculine
and feminine pronouns and compared frequencies within these
categories.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>These frequencies are the portion of pronouns of a certain
gender that are subject pronouns. Thus, on average, approximately 72% of
masculine pronouns in a given novel are subject pronouns while approximately
45% of feminine pronouns are subject pronouns.</p>

<p>Male:
0.7245328833821589</p>

<p>Female:
0.44787289273153363</p>

<h3>Binned</h3>

<p>The following are averages of the same frequency but binned
over author gender, date published, and location.</p>

subject pronouns while only about 45% of female pronouns
were subject pronouns.</p>

<h2>Analysis 2</h2>

<p>This analysis looked at the percentage of subject pronouns
that were male verses female. The following frequencies are
the portion of subject pronouns that are female.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>Overall: 0.31606923574399076</p>

<p>Thus, on average, about 32% of the subject pronouns in a given

<h3>Thoughts</h3>

<p>For this analysis, we found the overall comparison and the
comparison by author gender most noteworthy. We noticed no
trends in the date binning, though there is a strange deviancy
from the norm in the 1830's. We noticed no trend based on location.</p>

<h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>

<p>Analysis #1 is probably the most useful of the two. The results
observed in analysis #2 are likely due to just the frequency of
male vs female pronoun use in general as observed in an earlier
analysis (see Pronoun Frequency).</p>
